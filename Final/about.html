          <h2>Cape Coral</h2>
            <img id="img1" src="" alt="">
              <p>Wycliffe Grafton Jr. was born on September 18th, 1996 in Pembroke Pines, FL. His parents, Wycliffe Grafton Sr. and Tania Barthelemy Grafton, are Cuban immigrants who fled Cuba for a better chance at life, not only for themsleves but as well for their future children. Soon after his birth, his parents made the choice to leave the southern east coast of FLorida where there was a deep Cuban culture to find new and better work opportunities. The family made their way to Cape Coral, FL. A city that Wycliffe and his younger brother, Bryant Louis Grafton, will call home for their entire childhood. Growing up in Cape Coral was difficult at first for Wycliffe and his family. His parents were new to the city and their English was unpolished and limited so their work opportunites were limited. Working in the labor industry is not easy, especially with two young boys at home and living in a country that was drastically different from what they knew. Wycliffe saw the struggle they were going through and understood from a young age that he had to work hard as well in everything. This determination to do better than his best and to achive high marks is what pushed him to do well in his school work. While he was raised in a Cuban household and would be around Cubans and other Latinos outside of school, he was also being raised in the American society. The duality of the culture impacted him heavily. While his parents were speaking to him in Spanish, he was spoken to in English from the kids his age. This would be the first clash of culture Wycliffe would face in his life and because of the confusion of languages he wouldn't speak in his early years. The clash of cultures is a resentment he had during his early childhood years. Ostracizing his Cuban culture, Wycliffe started losing touch with his hertiage and when he realized it was a part of him that he want to embrace, he was in his eighth grade year and there weren't any classes at the time to teach him. Not knowing his place in society, Wycliffe was lost in his childhood years. When children were having fun and worrying about what the next episode of Spongebob Squarepants, Wycliffe was also worrying about Spongebob but also who he was and his place in society. The one thing he did find was music.

              When he joined Begginner Band his sixth grade year, he didn't realize he found the first  identity he would feel comfortable with: Band kid. Wycliffe picked up the Tuba that first year and learned the Bass Guitar the following summer. Music and Band was a vital part of his life through his middle school and high school years. Everything about him was associated with Band. Music was the escape he needed to collect his thoughts and understand what was happening in his life. From heartbreak to the feeling of exclusion, music helped him get through those dark times. But music wasn't just a support system, it was also the gateway to the creativity stored in his mind. Unable to communcate his thoughts efficeiently and knowing no other way to express his thoughts, he would use music to calm him and as a guide to crate worlds where things made sense to him. While Musica was his identity during the latter half of his childhood, he had other interest which led him to his first production class: Intro TV Production. At the time, he had no interest in pursuing the subject as a life but found the thought using a camera and a making a movie really fun. Fun it was, he would be in a production class from his Freshman year to his Junior year in highschool. He ran into the same situation that most young artist encounter, 'continue with the subject I love or focus on harder classes to get into a good college and have a career', well Wycliffe choose the latter and take a step back from filmmaking for a while. Focusing on harder classes and college submissions he came to regret not taking a production class his last year of highschool. At the time he didn't want to go into any Art career, he wanted to be a politcian and study International Affairs so he set his sights on getting into universities that would give him the best chance. He applied to the Ivy league and other top universities. The rejection letters coming in was the first time in Wycliffe's life that his ego was damaged in the sense of his academic strength. At 18 years old, he had to take a step back and reevaluate who he was and what he wanted to do. As soul crushing and disappointing the letters were, one university did give a chance and that was the University of Miami. While it was not his first choice, he would come to realize that it was the right choice for him and the perfect place for him to grow. </p>

          <h2>Miami</h2>
            <img id="img2" src="" alt="">
              <p>Wycliffe considers Miami his second hometown. Not only did he attend the University of Miami, he has been visiting the city sense he was a young boy. His parents were the one of the first of their families to come to the United States and deeply missed their brothers, sisters, and parents in Cuba. Though Wycliffe's parents struggled to get to the USA, they didn't want their family to go through the same. Reclaiming family memebers throughout the years meant many trips to Miami to pick them up from the airport, but also having family settle in Miami and visiting them throughout the years. Growing up Wycliffe saw much of the Hispanic side of Miami and much of the beach scene. The Miami he knew as a child was not the Miami of glamour or parties, but the Miami of Latinos and immigrant families. The homecooking of his grandmothers, aunts and uncles, the birthday parties for all his cousins, the spanish movies and telenovelas his family would watch, the warmth of his family is the Miami of young Wycliffe.

              The move to Miami was difficult for Wycliffe. Still not sure who he was, Wycliffe had to rest start his life and his persona. Going to his school that he knew no one, Wycliffe relied on Band to be his outlet to meet new people. Through the Marching Band at the University of Miami, he meet people who would become life long friends. He also meet the guys he would come to call brothers in the music fraternity Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia. Though music has always been an outlet and an identity for Wycliffe, he wanted to branch out and discover other sides of himself. It was in that first semester of college that Wycliffe came to a realization, 'Why don't I take a film class?' A question and a decesion that drastically changed his life. The thought of taking film classes and eventually adding it as a major was suppose to be secandary to his International Studies major. Well that changed during the first semester of his Sophomore year. While taking a bulk of the intro film courses, he came across a professional cinematic organization called Delta Kappa Alpha. Through the organization Wycliffe began to florish as filmmaker and use what he had been learning in his classes. The experience working on other people sets and leading his own, Wycliffe began to understand the complexity of filmmaking. Through the struggles he faced as a director and producer, he solidified his dedication to filmmaking. Opting in to spend his last semester in Los Angeles, he will be working at an internship gaining real experience working in the industry and what life is like to live in LA. Wycliffe will be graduating in the Spring of 2019 with a Bachelor of Science in Motion Pictures Production and International Studies.
